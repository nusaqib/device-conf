in place after this firmware update. However,  you will not be able to configure more of them, and if you remove a multiple
association after the update, you will not be able to re-instate it. If you need to configure an output relay to change
state as a result of multiple sensor alert conditions, you can still configure Events and Smart Alerts to change a relay
state based on multiple sensor alert conditions.

Web interface). Within 30 seconds the E-xD will re-sense the E-ACLM-V/P and will include the Frequency

sensor in the list of sensors. All applicable sensors included with the E-ACLM-V/P (including Frequency

Sensor(s)) will then be available for configuration.
